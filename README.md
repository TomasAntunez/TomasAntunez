# Hi, I'm Chuli 👋

I'm a full-stack product engineer who ships end-to-end software — from discovery and architecture to deployment and iteration.

**Core stack:** TypeScript · Node.js/NestJS · React/Next.js · React Native · AWS<br />
**I care about:** Clean Architecture · event-driven systems · testing · DX

## Featured work

- [chuli-dev-libs](https://github.com/TomasAntunez/chuli-dev-libs) — production-ready TypeScript libraries to speed up delivery across Node/Web/React/React Native.

## Currently building

- **Shinobi Ledger** — personal finance platform (WIP). Public release when it’s ready.

## How I like to work

- Pragmatic architecture with strong fundamentals (typing, testing, clean APIs)
- Product mindset: ship iteratively, learn fast, improve continuously
- Clear communication and ownership
