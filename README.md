# Hi, I'm Tomás ("Chuli") 👋

I'm a **full-stack product engineer** focused on building and shipping end-to-end software:
from discovery → architecture → implementation → deployment → iteration.

**Core stack:** TypeScript, Node.js/NestJS, React/Next.js, React Native, AWS
**Engineering interests:** clean architecture, event-driven systems, testing, and developer experience.

## Featured work

- **chuli-dev-libs** — production-ready TypeScript libraries to speed up delivery across Node/Web/React/React Native.
  https://github.com/TomasAntunez/chuli-dev-libs

## Currently building

- **Shinobi Ledger** — a personal finance platform (early stage / work in progress).
  (Public release when it’s ready.)

## How I like to work

- Pragmatic architecture with strong fundamentals (typing, testing, clean APIs)
- Product mindset: ship iteratively, learn fast, improve continuously
- Clear communication and ownership
